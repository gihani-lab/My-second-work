                History
            </h2>
            <p>
                During the early part of the 18th century, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and
                white
                King Charles type
                spaniels for hunting. The duke recorded that they were able to keep up with a trotting horse. His
                estate
                was named
                Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and
                white variety of the
                King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.In
                1926, the American Roswell Eldridge offered a dog show class prize of 25 pounds of sterling silver
                each as a prize
                for the best male and females of "Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in pictures of Charles
                II of England's
                time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull."[7]
                The breeders of the
                era were appalled, although several entered what they considered to be sub-par Cavalier King Charles
                Spaniels in the
                competition. Eldridge died before seeing his plan come to fruition, but several breeders believed in
                what he said and in
                1928 the first Cavalier club was formed.[7] The first standard was created, based on a dog named
                "Ann's Son" owned by
                Mostyn Walker,[8] and the Kennel Club recognised the variety as "King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier
                type".[7]

                The Second World War caused a drastic setback to the emerging breed, with the vast majority of
                breeding stock destroyed
                because of wartime hardship and food shortages. For instance, in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel, the
                population of 60 dogs
                dropped to three during the 1940s.[9] Following the war, few dogs survived as the new beginning from
                which all
                present-day Cavaliers descend. And in 1945,[10] the Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its
                own right as the
                Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.[7]

                The first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956
                by W. Lyon Brown
                who, together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts, founded the Cavalier King Charles Club
                USA that continues
                to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created by a group
                of breeders to apply
                for recognition by the American Kennel Club. It was recognised by the American Kennel Club in
                1995,[1] and the ACKCSC
                became the parent club for Cavaliers.[11] Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United
                States and ranks as the
                15th most popular pure-breed in the United States

                Description
            </h2>
            <p>
                Historically the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was a lap dog and is small for a spaniel, with
                fully grown adults
                comparable in size to adolescents of other larger spaniel breeds. The tail is usually not
                docked,[13] and the Cavalier
                should have a silky coat of moderate length. Standards state that it should be free from curl,
                although a slight wave is
                allowed. Feathering can grow on their ears, feet, legs and tail in adulthood. Standards require
                this be kept long, with
                the feathering on the feet a particularly important aspect of the breed's features.[13]

                The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the English Toy Spaniel can often be confused with each
                other. In the United
                Kingdom, the English Toy Spaniel is called the King Charles Spaniel, while in the United States,
                one of the colours of
                the Toy Spaniel is known as King Charles. The two breeds share similar history and only diverged
                from each other about
                100 years ago.[citation needed] There are several major differences between the two breeds, with
                the primary difference
                being size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between 13 to 18 pounds (5.9 to 8.2 kg), the
                King Charles is smaller at
                9 to 15 pounds (4.1 to 6.8 kg). In addition, their facial features, while similar, are
                different; the Cavalier's ears
                are set higher and its skull is flat, while the King Charles's skull is domed. Finally, the
                muzzle length of the
                Cavalier tends to be longer than that of its King Charles cousin.[7][14]

                Colour
            </h2>
            <p>
                The breed has four recognized colours. Cavaliers that have rich chestnut markings on a
                pearly white
                background are known
                as Blenheim in honor of Blenheim Palace, where John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough
                raised for
                assistance in hunting
                the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour. In some Blenheim dogs
                there is a
                chestnut spot in the
                middle of the forehead: this is called the "Blenheim" spot.[15] The Blenheim spot is also
                known as
                the
                mark of the
                "Duchess Thumb Print", based on the legend that Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough
                while
                awaiting
                news of her
                husband's safe return from the Battle of Blenheim, pressed the head of an expecting dam with
                her
                thumb,
                resulting in
                five puppies bearing the lucky mark after news that the battle had been won

                Black and Tan are dogs with black bodies with tan highlights, particularly eyebrows,
                cheeks, legs and beneath the
                tail.[17] Black and Tan is referred to as "King Charles" in the King Charles Spaniel.[7]

                Ruby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut all over,[18] although some can have some
                white in their coats that is
                considered a fault under American Kennel Club conformation show rules.[19]

                The fourth colour is known as Tricolour, which is black and white with tan markings on
                cheeks, inside ears, on eyebrows,
                inside legs, and on underside of tail.[17] This colour is referred to as "Prince
                Charles" in the King Charles
                Spaniel.[7]
